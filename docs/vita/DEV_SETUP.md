# Vita dev environment

How to build, run, log and debug WoWee for the PS Vita. Everything here lives in `docs/vita/` and
`tools/vita/`; no upstream file is touched (see [FORK_POLICY.md](FORK_POLICY.md)).

**Verification status.** Sections marked *(verified)* were run on the maintainer's Mac (Apple
Silicon, `container` CLI). Sections marked *(unverified)* need a Vita or Vita3K and have not been
run yet; the acceptance checklist at the bottom is where they get confirmed.

## 1. Toolchain

### Option A: container image (recommended) *(verified: build)*

The image `vitasdk/vitasdk` is multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`), so it runs natively on
Apple Silicon. `$VITASDK` and `PATH` are already set inside it.

- **Pin a dated tag** in scripts and CI: currently `vitasdk/vitasdk:2026.08-20260925`
  (GCC 15.2.0, `arm-vita-eabi`). The floating `2026.08` is rebuilt as packages move; use it only for
  experiments. Dated tags are listed at https://hub.docker.com/r/vitasdk/vitasdk/tags.
- Runtime: macOS uses Apple's `container` CLI (`container system start` once per boot); Linux and CI
  use `docker` or `podman`. Override with `CONTAINER_RUNTIME=...`, and the image with `VITASDK_IMAGE=...`.

```sh
tools/vita/build.sh                                   # repo root (the real target arrives with VITA-4)
SRC=tools/vita/devcheck BUILD=build-vita/devcheck tools/vita/build.sh   # the dev-loop test app
```

`build-vita/` is not in the upstream `.gitignore` (shared file, left alone). Add it locally:
`echo 'build-vita/' >> .git/info/exclude`.

### Option B: native `vdpm` *(unverified)*

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vitasdk/vdpm && cd vdpm
./bootstrap-vitasdk.sh
export VITASDK=/usr/local/vitasdk
export PATH=$VITASDK/bin:$PATH
./install-all.sh
```

Then `cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$VITASDK/share/vita.toolchain.cmake ...`. Prefer Option A: it
pins the exact toolchain and does not touch the host.

## 2. Hardware

- A hacked Vita: firmware 3.60 or 3.65 with Enso is the recommended baseline (HENkaku / h-encore /
  Trinity also work). A PS TV runs homebrew too.
- **VitaShell**: FTP server (press SELECT; port **1337**) and VPK installer.
- **SD2Vita** adapter + microSD for the game data (several GB; see VITA-24).
- Optional: **vitacompanion** plugin (FTP plus a command server on port 1338 to launch/kill apps from
  the PC).
- **Clocks for measurements:** record the stock clocks, CPU 444 MHz, GPU 222 MHz, bus 222 MHz, and do
  not install an overclocking plugin (PSVshell etc.) unless a measurement needs it. If you do, write
  the clocks next to the numbers.

## 3. Emulator: Vita3K

Vita3K is for **smoke tests only** (does it boot, does the UI come up, does the log appear). It does
**not** replace hardware: its speed and memory behaviour say nothing about the real device, so every
performance or memory number must come from a Vita. Install the VPK via File > Install .vpk.

## 4. Deploy loop *(unverified on hardware)*

Install `devcheck.vpk` (or later the WoWee VPK) once with VitaShell, then iterate by replacing only
`eboot.bin` over FTP:

```sh
export VITA_IP=192.168.1.50                      # shown by VitaShell
tools/vita/deploy.sh build-vita/devcheck/eboot.bin DEVC00001
VITA_RESTART=1 tools/vita/deploy.sh ...          # with vitacompanion: kill and relaunch the app
tools/vita/deploy.sh --logs                      # fetch ux0:data/wowee/* into build-vita/logs/
```

## 5. Logging

Decision: **two sinks, both always available.**

1. **File** `ux0:data/wowee/<app>.log` (WoWee: `wowee.log`): survives crashes, fetched over FTP.
2. **UDP net-logger** (optional): if `ux0:data/wowee/loghost.txt` contains `<ip>[:port]` (default
   port 9999), each line is also sent as one UDP datagram. On the dev machine: `tools/vita/logsink.sh`
   (a thin `nc -ul`). UDP is lossy by design; the file is the source of truth.

`tools/vita/devcheck/main.c` is the reference implementation; the WoWee logger arm (a Vita arm in
`src/core/logger.cpp` calling code under `src/platform/vita/`) comes with the platform work.

## 6. Crash dumps

Homebrew crashes write a `*.psp2dmp` core dump (gzip) to `ux0:data`. Symbolize with
[`vita-parse-core`](https://github.com/xyzz/vita-parse-core), which needs the **unstripped ELF from
the same build** as the `eboot.bin` that crashed (the ELF target, not `eboot.bin` or `.velf`), built
with `-g`.

```sh
tools/vita/deploy.sh --logs     # or copy the dump from ux0:data with VitaShell
tools/vita/parse_core.sh path/to/core.psp2dmp build-vita/devcheck/devcheck
```

The script runs the tool in the VitaSDK image (it needs the toolchain's `objdump` and `addr2line`),
pinned to commit `644b5f0`. Notes from setting it up *(verified)*: the image has no pip, and the tool
needs `pyelftools<=0.29` (0.30 removed `elftools.common.py3compat`), so the script installs
`python3-pip` and `pyelftools==0.29` on each run. **Keep the ELF of every build you deploy**; a dump
cannot be symbolized without it.

## 7. Test server

Use a local AzerothCore 3.3.5a (optionally vmangos 1.12 for Vanilla) in Docker on the LAN; the Vita
connects to the host's LAN address, port 3724. Setup reference: [../server-setup.md](../server-setup.md)
and https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/. Create the account and raise it to GM level for teleporting:

```
account create vita <password>
account set gmlevel vita 3 -1
```

(AzerothCore worldserver console; `.tele`, `.go xyz` etc. are then available in game.) *(unverified:
no server has been brought up for this project yet.)*

## 8. Acceptance checklist (VITA-2)

- [x] `tools/vita/build.sh` builds `devcheck.vpk` + `eboot.bin` in the pinned image on macOS (arm64).
- [ ] devcheck installed and run on **hardware**; log fetched over FTP and via `logsink.sh`.
- [ ] devcheck run on **Vita3K**.
- [ ] TRIANGLE crash on hardware produces a `.psp2dmp`; `parse_core.sh` symbolizes it against
      `build-vita/devcheck/devcheck` and shows `main` / `main.c` at the faulting line.
- [ ] Local AzerothCore reachable from the Vita's network.
